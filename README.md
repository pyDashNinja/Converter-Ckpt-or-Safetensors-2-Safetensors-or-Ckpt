Special thanks to this repo : https://github.com/diStyApps/Safe-and-Stable-Ckpt2Safetensors-Conversion-Tool-GUI.git, All the credit goes to them.. I have just made simpler if someone wants to use only terminal to convert safetensors to ckpt and ckpt to safetensors without using gui and installing multiple libraries
